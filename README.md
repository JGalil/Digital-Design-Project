# **Microprocessor Design Project**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the design and implementation of a custom processor for **CSE 141L**, including Verilog modules, an assembler, and testbenches for three floating-point operations. The project evaluates performance and correctness through RTL simulations and testbench outputs.

## **Processor Design**
This project implements a **lightweight floating-point processor** designed to execute simple operations efficiently. The processor supports:
1. **Integer to Floating-Point Conversion**
2. **Floating-Point to Integer Conversion**
3. **Floating-Point Addition**

The **Control Unit**, **ALU**, **Register File**, and **Memory Modules** are written in Verilog. The **top-level module (`top_level.sv`)** integrates all components.

## **Programs and Machine Code**
- **Program 1 (Int to Float Conversion)**: Works correctly. The correct machine code is `assembled_ms3_pgm1_FINAL.txt`.
- **Program 2 (Float to Int Conversion)**: Works correctly but requires handling of two’s complement for negative numbers. The correct machine code is `assembled_ms3_pgm2_v4.txt`.
- **Program 3 (Float Addition)**: Works correctly but has testbench overwriting issues. The correct machine code is `assembled_ms3_pgm3_v9.txt`.

### **Testbench Results**
The results from RTL simulations are stored in `CSE 141L Final Submission Outputs and RTL.pdf`. The key points include:
- Programs 1 and 2 pass all test cases.
- Program 3 experiences testbench overwriting, affecting certain results but when correct test case outcomes are compared with the output, the program does pass the test cases.
- The processor performs efficiently with simple and lightweight instructions.

## **Assembler**
The assembler is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook (`assembler.ipynb`). It translates assembly code into machine code for execution on the processor.

## **How to Use**
1. **Set the Correct Paths**  
   - Update `instr_ROM.sv` with the appropriate paths for each program’s machine code.

2. **Run the Simulation**  
   - Use **ModelSim/QuestaSim/VCS** or another Verilog simulator to compile and run testbenches.

3. **View Results**  
   - Compare output values with testbench expectations.
   - Use a waveform viewer to inspect memory locations if discrepancies occur.

## **Evaluation of Performance**
- The processor is **efficient** in executing floating-point operations.
- It completes all computations **without errors**, except for minor testbench behavior in **Program 3**.
- The lightweight instruction set ensures **fast execution**.
